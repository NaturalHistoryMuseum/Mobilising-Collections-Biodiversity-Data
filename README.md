# Mobilising Biodiversity Data for Natural History Collections
More and more biodiversity data are being published and shared online everyday, giving us all new opportunities to engage whether through data mobilization, data use in research and education, software design, policy development, etc. Exciting projects, programs, and new methods too, expand on what we can and will be able to do with these data. But, getting started and keeping up with trends and activities in biodiversity informatics and collections digitisation can be overwhelming.

As part of the national [DiSSCo UK](https://www.dissco-uk.org/) partnership, The Natural History Museum, London is collaborating with natural history collections communities around the UK to support the mobilisation and sharing of their collections data.

Typical workshop content will include, lectures, discussion, and hands-on sections. Expect to help each other share insights into the needs of our broader network and the expertise and opportunities available.  

### Our next planned workshop is:

**Mon, 10 July 2023** - ["An introduction to mobilising your collection’s biodiversity data"](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/Mobilising-Collections-Biodiversity-Data/blob/master/2023-07-10/2023-07-10-schedule.md) co-organised by [NatSCA](https://www.natsca.org/) and NHM, London. **Location**: (in-person) Natural History Museum, London. **NB: Registration is now closed but we hope to run more workshops later in the year**


### Previous workshops include:

* **Mon, 11 November 2019** - [Mobilising Collection's Biodiversity Data - NatSca Workshop 2019](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/Mobilising-Collections-Biodiversity-Data/blob/master/2019-11-11/2019-11-11-schedule.md)

We were heavily inspired by [TDWG's Biodiversity Informatics 101 Workshop at Biodiversity Next](https://github.com/tdwg/curriculum/blob/master/biodiversity-informatics-101/bi101_schedule_2019.md) and the training has roots in a [2018 session delivered by iDigBio with NHM and Bristol Museums](https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/index.php/UK-SWANSPracticalDigitisation).
