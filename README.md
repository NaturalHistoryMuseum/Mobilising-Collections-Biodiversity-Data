# Mobilising Collection's Biodiversity Data Workshops
More and more biodiversity data are coming online everyday and give all of us new opportunities to engage whether it is through data mobilization, data use in research and education, software design, policy development, etc. Exciting projects, programs, and new methods too, expand on what we can and will be able to do with these data. But, getting started and keeping up with trends and activities in biodiversity informatics and collections digitisation can be overwhelming.

As part of the national [DiSSCo UK](https://www.dissco-uk.org/) partnership, The Natural History Museum, London is collaborating with natural history collections communities around the UK to support the mobilisation and sharing of their collections data.

Typical workshop content will include, lectures, discussion, and hands-on sections. Expect to help each other share insights into the needs of our broader network and the expertise and opportunities available.  

### Our next planned workshop is:

**Mon, 10 July 2023** - "An introduction to mobilising your collection’s biodiversity data" co-organised by [NatSCA](https://www.natsca.org/) and NHM, London. **Location**: (in-person) Natural History Museum, London. **Register your interest on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/an-introduction-to-mobilising-your-collections-biodiversity-data-tickets-654751739077).**

We were heavily inspired by [TDWG's Biodiversity Informatics 101 Workshop at Biodiversity Next](https://github.com/tdwg/curriculum/blob/master/biodiversity-informatics-101/bi101_schedule_2019.md) and he training has roots in a [2018 session delivered by iDigBio with NHM and Bristol Museums](https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/index.php/UK-SWANSPracticalDigitisation).
