# Mobilising Collection's Biodiversity Data - NatSca Workshop 2023
As more biodiversity data are becoming available, so too are new opportunities to engage with that data. Whilst exciting new projects and programs are creating novel methodologies which will expand on what we can and will be able to do with these data, getting started and keeping up with trends and activities in biodiversity informatics and collections digitisation can be overwhelming.

NatSCA are working with the Natural History Museum, London  as part of [DiSSCo UK](https://www.dissco-uk.org/) to develop an introductory workshop to help the natural history collection community mobilise and share their collections data.

The workshop content will include, lectures, discussion, and hands-on sections. Expect to help each other share insights into the needs of our broader network and the expertise and opportunities available.  

We were heavily inspired by [TDWG's Biodiversity Informatics 101 Workshop at Biodiversity Next](https://github.com/tdwg/curriculum/blob/master/biodiversity-informatics-101/bi101_schedule_2019.md) and has roots in a [2018 session delivered by iDigBio with NHM and Bristol Museums](https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/index.php/UK-SWANSPracticalDigitisation).
