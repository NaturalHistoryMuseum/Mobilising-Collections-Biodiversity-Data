# Questions and discussion topics from workshop participants

1. {How do} revisions to taxonomy affect on data and making {information} available on GBIF?
2. We have limited ability to photograph and barcode label our collections - is there still scope for us to transcribe data labels and what would be the best way to do this?
Do you have any advice on how we can speed up this process in the future?
What is a good process for recording data labels when they are illegible or hard to read?
What potential do our environmental archaeological assemblages and modern reference collections data hold for GBIF?
What current data are useful for GBIF and what further useful data can we extract from our specimens (eg genetics) and specimen data?
What are the minimum data and data protocol requirements for collections databases?
Practical workflows - know the theory, how do you actually do it, step by step? 
Which databases and standardised fields to use - where to start? Darwin Core? How to make data interoperable - serving to GBIF, NBN, JSTOR Plants etc?
How to 'staff' and fundraise for small through to major projects, when you're starting from no staff? Relying on volunteers does not feel sustainable - or ethical, and requires a huge amount of supervision so doesn't necessarily save much time
{How can I start} with little experience of data requests, formats or exports from the CMS?
How can I access various new solutions/ideas to mobilise data, when our database software is inadequate?
How can I best image collections with the equipment we have? 
What do others need from our data?
How to make data available on GBIF? 
What is metadata? 
How to digitise collections with a limited budget? 
Are there funding streams available to support such work, if so who can apply and when?
Ways to maximise efficiency in getting data on to museum catalogue for in house use and to get data to where it is most accessible to end users
How to cope with historical data and imprecise data? Taxonomically and geographically vague data.
How to prioritise when planning digitisation/data projects?
What are the habitats where data mobilisation (cross-cutting collection categories) would be most useful to researchers?
What funding streams are available for contributing data to national and international networks?
"What preparation is required?
How easy/difficult?
What type of data format can be mobilised?
Starting at the beginning: in a multidisciplinary large collection how do we prioritise what do first ( maybe that is an internal strategic question but what factors should inform the decision)?
What exactly do we need to do, who needs to be involved and how do we fund it?
Is GBIF the main player in town?
