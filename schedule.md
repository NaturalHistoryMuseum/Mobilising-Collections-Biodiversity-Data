## Mobilising Collection's Biodiversity Data - NatSca Workshop 2019
More and more biodiversity data are coming online everyday and give all of us new opportunities to engage whether it is through data mobilization, data use in research and education, software design, policy development, etc. Exciting projects, programs, and new methods too, expand on what we can and will be able to do with these data. But, getting started and keeping up with trends and activities in biodiversity informatics and collections digitisation can be overwhelming.

NatSCA are working with the Natural History Museum London and Bristol Culture to develop an introductory workshop to help the NatSCA community mobilise and share their collections data.

The workshop content will include, lectures, discussion, and hands-on sections. Expect to help each other share insights into the needs of our broader network and the expertise and opportunities available.
